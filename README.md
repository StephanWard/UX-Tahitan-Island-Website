# WGUUserExperienceWebsite
Introduction

Usability testing is a critically important step in the user experience design process. In order to create a quality experience that meets the needs of your users, you will need to collect data and feedback from those users at multiple points in the design process. You will then need to consider this feedback and make any necessary modifications to improve your design.


For this task, you will access the platform for usability testing at the web link provided below. You will use this platform to submit your prototype from Task 1 for usability testing. You will then be prompted to submit feedback on designs from your fellow students. You will use Panopto to record this feedback. Then you must confirm the permissions on your video are set to “public” and submit your video files to the platform.


After you have provided user feedback for three separate prototypes, you will be able to view the video feedback from other students on your own design. You will use this feedback from your users to inform the remainder of your submission. You will also need to upload the PDF version of your final report from the platform for evaluation. Your submission for this task includes everything you will upload to the platform and the files you will upload , as outlined in the requirements section below.


By conducting usability tests and evaluating the results, you will develop a deeper understanding of the users you are designing for, and may even uncover needs and wants that you were previously unaware of. Incorporating your findings into each subsequent iteration of your design allows you to create a product that truly satisfies your users.


Note:  The file size limit for your submission cannot be more than 16 MB.  Files larger than 16 MB cannot not be accepted.
Scenario

Great news! The Tanitian government has reviewed the latest version of your prototype, and they are very excited about your progress. They would like you to submit your prototype for usability testing, and they have also asked you to provide user feedback for three other designs they are considering.
Requirements

Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.


You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

A.  Submit your prototype on the Usability Testing Site, including five objective usability tasks you want users to test in your prototype. 


B.  Record yourself and your screen as you give verbal feedback as a user on three other submissions on the Usability Testing Site. Include your responses to each usability task given with each prototype and submit these videos on the Usability Testing Site. 


Note: Use Panopto to record your user testing videos. Your videos should feature you visibly testing the prototypes while wearing professional attire (i.e., not in voiceover or embedded video). The video should simultaneously capture both you and your user-testing screen. You should provide a verbal narration and qualitative feedback and reactions as you perform each usability task.


Note: For instructions on how to access and use Panopto, go to the "web links" section below. When preparing to record, be sure to select the recording folder to "User Experience Design HJP1 | C856 (student creators) [assignments]". If you happen to record to your "My Folder" you'll need to apply viewing permissions for your peers to be able to view your videos. Open the video, open Settings, select Share, then apply "Unlisted, anyone at your organization who has the link can view".

 

Note: If you have any problems accessing Panopto or the HJP1 recording folder please contact Assessment Services at assesmentservices@wgu.edu. It may take up to two business days to receive your WGU Panopto recording permission once you have enrolled in the course.

Note:  The file size limit for your submission cannot be more than 16 MB.  Files larger than 16 MB cannot not be accepted.


C.  Upload your final PDF report from the Usability Testing Site. 


Note: You will not be able to access the PDF report until you have completed the tasks above.


D.  Summarize the feedback from the three reactions you received on your design, including the feedback you received on each of the usability tasks you submitted for testing, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable. 


E.  Summarize how your design changed through the entire UX Design process, from the wireframe you created and guerrilla tested, to using the feedback from the usability testing. 


F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized. 


Note: You are only required to cite sources from outside this assessment. You are not required to cite reactions from other users. 


G.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
